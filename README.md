  ## Installation
  1. Clone this repo into the desired folder.
  2. Run npm install in the command line of the root directory.
  3. Create a .env file in the root directory and include DB_NAME = ecommerce_db, DB_USER, and DB_PW. This is personal info so you don't want this pushed up on the internet.
  4. Access MySQL by entering, mysql -u <your-username> -p followed by your password.
  5. Run source db/schema.sql from the MySQL shell then type quit to exit shell.
  6. Seed the data by running npm run seed.
  7. npm start will get the application running.
  8. Insomnia Core is the request client I used for testing the endpoints.
